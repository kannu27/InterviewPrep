## Trees

1. Use recursion - define the base case and recursive case
2. Optimize the number of recursive calls, by changing the logic of the return value 
    - Lowest Common ancestor is good example for this - https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/
3. Use standard traversal algorithms to solve problems - 
    - Inorder traversal gives the sorted list of elements in binary tree
    - Preorder traversal always prints the tree nodes in the order, root, left and then right.
      Good technique to check of subtrees, with adding a "X" for the null nodes at child.
