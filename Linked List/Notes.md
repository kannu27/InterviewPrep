# Useful Tips, Techniques and notes

1. Use two pointer approach whenever possible
2. Use a dummy node to head, to handle corner cases. Useful in cases where you need to keep track of previous pointer to the curr loop pointer. 
3. Using stack data structure for linked lists and problems involving palindrome, needing to check something in reverse order is convinient if we could use more space.
